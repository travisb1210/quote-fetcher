# quote-fetcher
Simple single page quote fetcher application. Fetches quotes from the URL defined in script.js and then every 10 seconds displays a  new random author, quote, and image of the author if the switch block contains the author name. The first fetch directly calls the URL and stores the result in a var **dataCache** that will be used any time the interval stopped and then started again.
